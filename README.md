# MazedAndConfused
A collection of Maze algorithms in Swift based on a variety of influences.

Currently, this code is a Swift port of the Ruby maze algorithms found in the [Pragmatic Programming](http://www.pragprog.com/) book [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers). Over time, additional algorithms will be added and the code will drift from the initial port, however I wanted to be sure to credit the initial source.
